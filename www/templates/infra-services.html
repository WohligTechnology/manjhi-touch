				<p> Once the data for the Collection has been mapped, Aura Art Development Pvt Ltd ("AADPL") will Value the Art Collection, based on available benchmarks.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Auction records constitute the most credible third party data available to the public. AADPL has consistently mapped all auction results (by Sotheby's, Christies, Osians, Saffronart etc) of significant Indian artists over last 10 years.</li>
					<li>Each Painting is valued within the range of Per Sq Feet values that similar works of the respective artists command, to the extent data is available.</li>
					<li>For other cases, we will utilize our industry network to create appropriate bench marks.</li>
				</ul>
				<span>2.Insurance</span>
				<p> Once the Art Collection is valued, we will provide guidance for insuring the collection, viz:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Identify which part of the collection to be insured and value: cost vs market value</li>
					<li>Risks to be covered (stay risks vs transit risks) and exclusions</li>
					<li>Negotiate quotes and other terms with insurer(s)</li>
					<li>Guide on checks and balances to be put in place on an on-going basis. Periodic review to assess compliance with intended processes, to ensure smooth and efficient renewal</li>

					<li>Artists respond to the world around them, create links between communities by developing work that is inclusive/ socially relevant, through an alternative voice of creativity. Therefore, exposing such art to people can enable them to understand their
						cultural, social, political, economic and natural environments better.</li>
					<li>Since India prides on its rich heritage and culture, corporate support towards the conservation and preservation of arts, heritage sites, manuscripts etc is vital</li>
					<li>Art is an effective way to engage/ interact with the community in an interesting way – hence the importance of Public art, including through public-private partnerships.</li>
				</ul>


				<ul>
					<li>Art triggers emotion and sensitizes people, therefore exposure to various kinds of art can soften people and lead to personal growth and sooth their nerves.</li>
					<li>Promotion of arts education can enable people to discover their inherent creative capability and provide a means of self expression and fulfillment.</li>
					<li>Art programs aimed at the upliftment of artists with lack of means and resources can foster better talent and eventually add to the already rich cultural fabric of India.</li>
